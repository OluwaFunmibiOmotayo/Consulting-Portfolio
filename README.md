This study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of fungicides against soil-borne pathogens in soybeans. The fungicide used was incorporated into the growth medium (petri dish) to ensure there was homogeneous distribution of this chemical across the different fungal species. To achieve this, they collected data based on the species of pathogens (isolates), different types of fungicide treatments and also at varying dose level. This experiment was setup this way so that it would mimic how the different fungicide would react with the pathogens in the natural soil conditions. 

This study performed a zero-inflated Gamma model to look at the effects of species, and treatments on the average fungal growth (positive continuous measurements with an excess of zeros), while also accounting for the nested structure of dose.  This model was fitted using the “glmmTMB” package in R
