my initial meeting with my client Kelvin Muchiri. He is currently
a Master’s student working at the department of plant
pathology and his advisor is Garcia-Aroca Teddy. He is interested
in investigating the efficacy of chemical applications in
controlling soil-borne pathogens of soybean.
The client indicated on the google form that they are interested
in performing a two-way ANOVA and Tukey-HSD tests
for their data on investigating the efficacy of chemical applications
in controlling soil-borne pathogens of soybean. To be
able to follow the prepare section of the POWER process, I
mailed the client to ask for their dataset and some information
on their previously done analysis prior to meeting since
they indicated they have initially conducted some analysis on
the data. This helped with getting prepared for our meeting
and also helped implement the PREPARE stage of the power
process.
During the open phase, we began by introducing ourselves
and took some few minutes to establish rapport between myself
and the domain expert. Also, before I asked them to
give me a more detailed explanation of their project again,
we briefly discussed their deadlines, their expectations and I
also took the time to explain how I’m going to be helping on
the project, after which we transitioned into the work phase. I
believe this phase was quite helpful as it kind of set a collaborative
and welcoming tone which made the domain expert
feel more comfortable.
During the main part of the consultation, which is the work
phase, I asked the domain expert to give me detailed explanation
of how they conducted the experiment again as it would
help me in determining the right approach to model their data.
The domain expert ability to clearly provide a pictorial representation
of their design was very helpful as it made me see
exactly what was going on in their experiment. While describing
his experiment, I noticed he had some nested structure he
was not aware of and also his dataset contains a lot of zero’s
which he also was not bothered about. So I had to explain
what a crossed and nested structure is and also asked more
question about the information the zero-values were providing.
The domain expert showed flexibility and willingness to
collaborate, as they were open to suggestions with regards to
analyzing their dataset in alignment with the way their experiment
was designed. Their consistent engagement, insightful
questions and calling my attention to explain what they do not
understand reflected their trust in our expertise and a readiness
to co-work with me on the analysis. After the initial meeting a
document summarizing the experiment objectives and design
was sent to the domain experts in order to be sure everyone is
aware of the work we’ve gotten so far and so to ask some other
questions that came up when I was reflecting on our meeting.
In general, I had an amazing experience working on this
project with the domain-expert. Having the opportunity to
collaborate directly with domain experts was a really great
experience. I learned so much just listening to them explain
their research approach and methodology. It was fascinating
to see how they conducted their work in practice. Being part
of a real-world project rather than just theoretical exercises
really deepened my understanding and made the whole experience
worthwhile.
